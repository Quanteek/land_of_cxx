Waldo
=====

In WALDO, you are playing a text based version of the famous *Where's Waldo?*
books from Martin Handford. The goal is to find the ``w`` character in an ascii
art image!

To begin with, the image in ``waldo.txt``, which suits perfectly the theme of
the game, is used. A minimal ``Makefile`` has been setup, as well as an even
more minimal version of the ``waldo`` program. Run::

    $> make

to build the program, then::

    $> ./waldo

to run it, and finally::

    $> git checkout waldo/level0

to start the tutorial!


Level 0
=======

The first step is to read the content of the ``waldo.txt`` file and to display
it on the screen. To do so, C++ provides an *input file stream* abstraction. You
can create such a file using::

    std::ifstream ifs{"waldo.txt"};

to do so you must make the ``std::ifstream`` type, from the standard library (as
hinted by the ``std::``) available to the compiler, by including the proper
header::

    #include <fstream>

It will just open the file for reading (``i`` stands for input). The easiest way
to manipulate the file is to slurps everything in a string. The standard library
defines a string type ``std::string`` through another header::

    #include <string>

One can build a string from anything that contains characters, which is the case
of our file. The following line involves a bit of dark magic::

    std::string waldo{std::istreambuf_iterator<char>{ifs},
                      std::istreambuf_iterator<char>{}
                     };

so lets explain it. We are creating a ``std::string`` variable named ``waldo``.
We are using two arguments (between curly braces) to initialize it. One denotes
the first character to read, the other denotes the end. To stream ``char`` out
of the file, we use a special wrapper, ``std::istreambuf_iterator<char>``
initialized by our file object for the beginning, and nothing for the end.

Finally we can stream the resulting string to the standard output::

    std::cout << waldo

and be wowed by the result!

In next level, we will hide a small ``w`` in the resulting image!

Level 1
=======

In the real game, Waldo is a nice guy with glasses and a stripped hat. In our
game, it will be a nice ``w`` (with glasses and a stripped hat?). We will hide
this letter in a random location in the ``waldo`` string, but it would be to
easy to put it in-place of a blank character, so we'll randomly pick a
character, check if it is a blank and iterate again if needed.

To begin with, a random number between ``0`` (included) and ``waldo.size()``
(excluded) is needed. C++ has a complex random number generation system, the
header we need is::

    #include <random>

and the typical idiom in that case is::

    std::random_device rd;
    std::default_random_engine rnd(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<size_t> uniform_dist(0, waldo.size() - 1);

as it make it possible to get a random number within the proper bound by
calling::

    size_t pos = uniform_dist(rnd);

where ``size_t`` is a convenient way to say "unsigned int large enough to index
the whole memory".

To check if the character at this particular location is a blank, one can use::

    std::isspace(waldo[pos])

so to keep picking chars until a non-blank value is found, we can use a loop::

    size_t pos;
    do {
        pos = uniform_dist(rnd);
    } while(std::isspace(from[pos]));

and finish the work by setting the proper position with the proper value::

    from[pos] = 'w';

Instead of writing all this in the ``main`` function, it would be nice to have
everything in a function that changes its argument in-place::

    void hide_waldo(std::string& from) {
    // function body
    }

where ``void`` means we are not producing any value, and ``(std::string& from)``
means the function takes a single argument named ``from`` of type
``std::string`` which is passed by reference (the ``&``) i.e. the function can
modify the argument, and the modification will be seen at the call site. The
call site simply looks like::

    hide_waldo(waldo);

Putting everything together, we now have a nice game! There are a few
limitations though, as we perform no check on user input!
